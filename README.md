# FlipARow
Simple board game to flip a row of squares.

The proto type is based on P5.js - but the final version will be based on d3.js

# The Idea
The idea in the game is to have a defined board with black - and white squares. The user has a limited number of flips to order the entire board to become white or black. The user will also have a time limitation - so the stress is on.
